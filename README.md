Machine learning is increasingly used for malware detection. When machine learning models are trained on file structures there is sometimes an easy way to evade detection by appending an obfuscation byte sequence to the end of the file. This tool constructs obfuscation bytes out of the original bytes of an executable. This has been shown to be effective against simple form of detection by neural networks. Another approach is to append bytes that the algorithm recognizes as benign. An interesting case study showing this approach can be found [here](https://skylightcyber.com/2019/07/18/cylance-i-kill-you/).

The tool is a proof of concept born out of a research project on malware detection with neural networks. No guarantees given that it will work against real-life anti-virus products.
