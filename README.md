Machine learning is increasingly used for malware detection. When machine learning models are trained on file structures there is sometimes an easy way to evade detection by appending an obfuscation byte sequence to the end of the file. This tool constructs obfuscation bytes out of the original bytes of an executable. This has been shown to be effective against simple form of detection by neural networks.

The tool is a proof of concept born out of experimentation. No guarantees given that it will work.
